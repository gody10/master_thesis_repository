## Setup Instructions

### Before Running:

1. Download and open Anaconda Prompt ([Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)).
2. Execute: `conda create -n your_env_name python=3.10.12` to create a virtual Conda environment with the specified Python version.
3. Activate the virtual Conda environment: `conda activate your_env_name`.
4. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to explore RL training and testing procedures.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and resource hub for understanding, experimenting with, and implementing RL models in the context of household energy optimization.

Feel free to explore the provided resources, engage in experiments, and contribute to the advancement of Reinforcement Learning methodologies within this wonderful field.
